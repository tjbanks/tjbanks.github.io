For my masters thesis I applied convolutional neural networks to the protein recognition problem under the direction of [Dr. Jainlin Cheng](http://calla.rnet.missouri.edu/cheng/).

This program is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network using DL4J on a 1 dimensional dataset provided by Dr. Cheng. See [http://iris.rnet.missouri.edu/dnfold/](http://iris.rnet.missouri.edu/dnfold/) for the training and testing sets.
