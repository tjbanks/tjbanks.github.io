**_Sim Builder_** is an easy to use desktop application that allows users to build large scale networks in Neuron. Utilizing Marianne J Bezaire's [CA1 model](https://github.com/mbezaire/ca1) as a backend, SimBuilder generalizes the process allowing users to specify their own network requirements.

The source and Windows executable is available for download [here](https://tylerbanks.net/SimBuilder/).

Also hosted on [CyNeuro.org](http://cyneuro.org/system/analytics/training_content).
