The blox game was prototyped over a weekend just for fun. Download the APK [here](/assets/Blox-proto5.apk)

# Penguin
The penguin cannon game was created when app games were starting to get popular. It's programmed in Java for the Android system using [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) as the backend.
